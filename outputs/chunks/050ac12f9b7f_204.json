However, I don’t see transformers in the list yet.\n\n✅ Step 1: Install transformers inside your USB virtual environment\nYou can install it like this from your active review_assistant_env:\n\nsource /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB\\ Drive/linux/pip/bin/activate\npip install transformers\nThis will install it locally inside your USB-mounted Python environment.\n\n✅ Step 2: Confirm install\nOnce installed, run this to confirm:\n\npython3 -c \"from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('summarization'))\"\nIf it prints a summary pipeline object (or prompts to download t5-small), you’re good.\n\n✅ Step 3: Use my updated file_summarizer.py\nOnce transformers is installed, the upgraded version I provided in the previous message will work with your existing setup — no internet needed after the model is downloaded once.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add a fallback so that:\n\nIf you're offline, it uses the local t5-small\n\nIf you're online and provide an OpenAI key, it uses GPT-4\n\nLet me know if you want that enhancement or prefer to keep it strictly local.\n\nYou said:\n(review_assistant_env) km_project@penguin:~$ python3 -c \"from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('summarization'))\"\nNone of PyTorch, TensorFlow >= 2.0, or Flax have been found.
