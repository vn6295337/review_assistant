Your system already has a solid foundation with well-structured components for chunking, summarization, semantic search, and prompt generation.\nHere's my assessment of your current system:\nWhat Works Well\n\nYou've built a clever solution to work around the limitations of free-tier LLMs\nThe chunking and summarization pipeline is well-designed\nYour shell scripts provide multiple interfaces for different use cases\nThe system is modular and follows good separation of concerns\n\nKey Improvements Needed\n\nThere's a syntax error in your full_rag_workflow.sh script (a closing brace instead of \"fi\")\nSome configuration is duplicated across scripts\nThe workflow could be streamlined for better user experience\nPerformance optimizations could help with large files\n\nI've created a detailed enhancement guide that addresses these issues and provides implementation strategies for improved performance, usability, and flexibility. The guide includes:\n\nSc",
