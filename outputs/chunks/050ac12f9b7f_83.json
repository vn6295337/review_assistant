Make sure those keys are consistent with how your chunk files are generated elsewhere (e.g., by your chunker or exporter).\n\nOutput format:\n\nRight now the summary is stored as JSON with keys \"source_file\" and \"summary\" containing Markdown-like text.\n\nIf you want to integrate this output with other tools, consider adding options for plain text or markdown output files.\n\nLogging vs print:\n\nFor larger workflows, switching from print() to Python's logging module will give more control over output verbosity and destination.\n\nBatch parallel processing:\n\nIf you have many chunk files, adding parallelism (e.g., with concurrent.futures) can speed up summarizing.\n\nError handling:\n\nIt’s already decent with try/except, but you could also return or collect detailed error reports for batch runs.\n\nSummary:\nYour current file_summarizer.py is fine as-is for your workflow.\n\nIt does not need refactoring because of the recent other file changes.\n\nOptional enhancements could improve robustness, output flexibility, or performance — I can help with that if you want.\n\nWant me to help implement any of these improvements, or keep it simple as-is?\n\nYou said:\ndo we need debug_rag_workflow.py?\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\nDebug RAG Workflow Script\n\nThis script checks your RAG workflow setup and diagnoses common issues.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport json\nimport sys\nimport glob\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Configuration\nROOT_D",
