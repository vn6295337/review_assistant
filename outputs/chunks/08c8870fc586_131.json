  "content": "er Chromebook Linux setup with limited local storage and no access to persistent LLM memory, file uploads, cloud compute, APIs, or vector DBs. The issues I currently face are as follows: 1. Context Window Management: Free tiers of ChatGPT and Claude cannot directly access your USB files. Every piece of content must be manually copied/pasted, which is impractical for large codebases. 2. Session Persistence: Free-tier models have no memory between sessions, forcing you to reestablish context repeatedly. 3. File Size Issues: 2+ million token files far exceed all free-tier context windows (typically 4K-32K tokens). 4. Manual Overhead: Managing file fragments and orchestrating the conversation flow manually would be extremely tedious and error-prone. 5. Chromebook Constraints: Linux on Chromebook has limited resources for running computationally intensive processes locally. My idea is to store large (e.g. >2M tokens) codebases, prompts, and notes on a USB drive mounted at /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/, and enable context-efficient offline review of these large files using RAG + prompt engineering strategies within the constraints of free LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude. \n\nSeems like  we have reviewed all the required files for this purpose. Can you trace the workflow, right from what users has to do from the beginning upto the final output generated, including decision points. \n\nUse simple visualization similar to the one shown below.\nreview_assistant/\n├── backups/              # Backup copies of important scripts\n├── chunks/               # Raw chunks of processed files\n├── codebase/             # Your code files and chat sessions\n│   └── chat_sessions/    # Exported AI chat sessions\n├── docs/                 # Documentation files\n├── outputs/              # Generated outputs\n│   ├── chunks/           # Processed chunks\n│   ├── prompts/          # Generated prompts for AI tools\n│   └── summaries/        # Summaries of chunks\n├── python/               ",
