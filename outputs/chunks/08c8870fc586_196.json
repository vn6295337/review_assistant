This suggests a potential issue where one might have been intended to serve a different purpose.\nLet me continue analyzing the system while I wait for any additional files you want to share. Based on what I've seen so far, I can provide some initial observations:\n\nThe system has a well-structured folder organization\nThe workflow appears to be functional but could use some refinements\nThere's some redundancy in the codebase (duplicate files)\nThe diagnostic tooling (debug_rag_workflow.py) is a nice touch\n\nNow that I've reviewed the available files, let me provide a comprehensive assessment of your local RAG pipeline and create a user guide for business users.\nAnalysis of Local RAG Pipeline\nSystem Overview\nYour system is a clever solution for working with large files through free-tier LLMs within Chromebook constraints. It breaks large files into chunks, summarizes them, and creates structured prompts that can be used with free AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude.\nKey Components\n\nFile Chunking: Breaks large files into manageable pieces\nSummarization: Creates concise summaries of each chunk\nInteractive Search: Allows semantic searching of chunks\nWorkflow Orchestration: Shell scripts that tie everything together\nChat Export: Utility to save and process AI conversations\n\nIssues to Address\n\nRedundant Files: mcp_helper.py and file_summarizer.py are identical. The mcp_helper.py should be for assembling master prompts, not summarizing.\nMissing Templates: The workflow references template files that may not be present or need updating.\nPotential Dependency Issues: The system analysis report identifies missing dependencies (flask, flask_sqlalchemy, jwt, sentence_transformers, werkzeug).\nWorkflow Cleanup: The main workflow script could be simplified f",
