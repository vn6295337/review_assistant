It works by breaking down large files into smaller chunks, creating summaries, and generating well-structured prompts that you can paste into AI assistants.\n\nThis guide will help you get started and make the most of this tool, even if you have limited technical knowledge.\n\n## **What is RAG?**\n\nRAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that helps AI models work with information that wouldn't fit in their context window (the amount of text they can process at once).\n\nIn simple terms:\n\n1. **Retrieval**: Finding the most relevant parts of your documents\n2. **Augmentation**: Adding this relevant information to your prompt\n3. **Generation**: Having the AI create a response based on this information\n\n## **System Requirements**\n\n- A Chromebook with Linux support\n- A USB drive with at least 1GB of free space\n- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your Chromebook's Linux environment\n- Internet connection (only for initial setup and using AI tools)\n\n## **Getting Started**\n\n### **First-Time Setup**\n\n1. **Install Dependencies** Open the Linux terminal on your Chromebook and run:\n    \n    \ncd /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/scripts\n    bash install_dependencies.sh\n\n    \n2. **Verify Installation** Run the environment check:You should see confirmation that all required dependencies are installed.\n    \n    \nbash check_python_env.sh\n\n    \n\n## **Using the RAG Assistant**\n\n### **Basic Workflow**\n\nThe typical workflow has three main steps:\n\n1. **Chunking**: Break a large file into smaller pieces\n2. *",
