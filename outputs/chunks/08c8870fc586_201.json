Let me analyze what you've provided:\nOverview of Your System\nYou've built a local, file-based RAG pipeline that can:\n\nBreak down large files into manageable chunks (via file_chunker.py)\nCreate summaries of each chunk (via file_summarizer.py)\nSearch through chunks using semantic search (via rag_assistant.py)\nGenerate structured prompts for use with free-tier LLMs (via mcp_helper.py)\nManage a workflow through various shell scripts\n\nAnalysis of the Scripts\nYour shell scripts provide different interfaces to your RAG system:\n\nfull_rag_workflow.sh - A comprehensive workflow script that handles:\n\nChecking/creating directories\nCreating chunks from source files\nGenerating summaries\nCreating final prompts for AI assistants\n\n\nrag_assistant.sh - Entry point for chunk-based semantic search:\n\nHandles full and simple modes\nSets up directories\nChunks codebase files\nLaunches the Python search assistant\n\n\nrag_helper.sh - Utility functions for managing the RAG pipeline:\n\nEnvironment checks\nFile cleaning and maintenance\nStatistics generation\nFile extraction and optimization tools\n\n\nrag_menu.sh - A menu-driven interface for:\n\nSearching chunks\nManaging multi-chunk prompts\nImporting/exporting prompts\n\n\ncheck_python_env.sh - Environment validation:\n\nChecks Python version\nVerifies required dependencies\nTests basic functionality\n\n\n\nKey Observations\n\nWell-structured system: You've built a comprehensive system with clear separation of concerns\nGood error handling: The scripts include checks and validations\nUser-friendly interfaces: Both menu-driven and direct command interfaces\nResourceful approach: Working within free-tier limitations\n\nSuggestions for Improvement\nLet me create a comprehensive guide with improvements to help you use this system more effectively.RAG ",
