The issues I currently face are as follows: 1. Context Window Management: Free tiers of ChatGPT and Claude cannot directly access your USB files. Every piece of content must be manually copied/pasted, which is impractical for large codebases. 2. Session Persistence: Free-tier models have no memory between sessions, forcing you to reestablish context repeatedly. 3. File Size Issues: 2+ million token files far exceed all free-tier context windows (typically 4K-32K tokens). 4. Manual Ov",
