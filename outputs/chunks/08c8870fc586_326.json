  "content": " no memory between sessions, forcing you to reestablish context repeatedly. 3. File Size Issues: 2+ million token files far exceed all free-tier context windows (typically 4K-32K tokens). 4. Manual Overhead: Managing file fragments and orchestrating the conversation flow manually would be extremely tedious and error-prone. 5. Chromebook Constraints: Linux on Chromebook has limited resources for running computationally intensive processes locally. My idea is to store large (e.g. >2M tokens) codebases, prompts, and notes on a USB drive mounted at /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/, and enable context-efficient offline review of these large files using RAG + prompt engineering strategies within the constraints of free LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude. \n\nSeems like  we have reviewed all the required files for this purpose. Can you trace the workflow, right from what users has to do from the beginning upto the final output generated, including decision points. \n\nUse simple visualization similar to the one shown below.\nreview_assistant/\n├── backups/              # Backup copies of important scripts\n├── chunks/               # Raw chunks of processed files\n├── codebase/             # Your code files and chat sessions\n│   └── chat_sessions/    # Exported AI chat sessions\n├── docs/                 # Documentation files\n├── outputs/              # Generated outputs\n│   ├── chunks/           # Processed chunks\n│   ├── prompts/          # Generated prompts for AI tools\n│   └── summaries/        # Summaries of chunks\n├── python/               # Python scripts\n├── scripts/              # Shell scripts for workflows\n├── templates/            # Prompt templates\n└── venv/                 # Python virtual environment\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions\nChatGPT said:\nBelow is a high‑level trace of the end‑to‑end RAG workflow for your Chromebook‑based setup.
