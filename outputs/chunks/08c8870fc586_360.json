So all files and setups of previous linux environment are gone. Can you guide me to reinstall those files and setups so that the rag workflow does not suffer\nChatGPT said:\nAbsolutely — let’s reinstall and restore your full RAG workflow environment on your Chromebook (after Linux was reset). I’ll walk you through everything step-by-step, assuming you want to get back to the state where:\n\nYou had Python + virtual environment on a USB drive\n\nYou were running chat_exporter.py, file_chunker.py, and your RAG tools\n\nYour workflow used review_assistant_env with files on /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/\n\n✅ Step 1: Enable Linux (Crostini)\nYou've already done this after the reset.\n\n✅ Step 2: Reinstall Essential Packages\nOpen the Linux Terminal and run:\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git unzip\n✅ Step 3: Recreate the Python Virtual Environment on USB\nAssuming your USB is mounted at /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/:\n\na. Go to your project folder on USB\ncd \"/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant\"\nb. Recreate the virtual environment\npython3 -m venv review_assistant_env\nc. Activate it\nsource review_assistant_env/bin/activate\n✅ Step 4: Reinstall Python Dependencies\nIf you had a requirements.txt, use it:\n\npip install -r requir",
