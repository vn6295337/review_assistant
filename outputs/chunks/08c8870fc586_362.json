Exiting.\n\nAfter I place text.txt in the codebnase/chat_sessions directory, chat_exporter.py clears the directory, I think\nChatGPT said:\nYes, you are absolutely right ‚Äî in the refactored chat_exporter.py, there's a line that clears the entire output directory at the beginning:\n\n# Clean slate: remove old session files\nshutil.rmtree(output_dir, ignore_errors=True)\nPath(output_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\nSo if you place text.txt inside the output directory, it gets deleted before the script can read it.\n\n‚úÖ ‚úÖ FIX: Keep input and output separate\nYou should always place your text.txt file outside the output directory, for example:\n\nGood location:\n/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/python/text.txt\n\nThen run:\n\npython3 python/chat_exporter.py --input-file \"python/text.txt\"\n‚úÖ ‚úÖ OPTIONAL: Modify script to avoid deleting input file\nIf you must keep the file inside codebase/chat_sessions/, we can modify the script to preserve it. Let me know if you want that version.\n\nBut the safest and cleanest solution is:\nkeep input in python/, let output go to codebase/chat_sessions/.\n\nWould you like me to adjust the script so it preserves specific input files, or is the separation of input/output fine for you?\n\nYou said:\nModify the chat exporter code such that it performs the following operations in the given order in RAG workdflow:\n1. User runs the chat_exporter.py from /python folder via bash\n2. It opens a blank nano file\n3. Prompts the user to paste a copied text\n4. Saves the nano file timestamped in the codebase/chat_session/ folder\n5. RAG workflow continues taking the latest timestamped file from codebase/cha",
