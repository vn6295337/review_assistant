Either implement or remove that logic for clarity.\n\nError handling:\nCould improve by adding better exception handling/logging (e.g., when loading chunks or saving results).\n\nTests:\nIf you haven’t already, consider adding unit tests for key functions like search_chunks and highlight_matches.\n\nSummary:\nYou don’t need to refactor it because of your recent project changes.\n\nIf you want, I can help implement missing create command or improve CLI UX.\n\nOtherwise, it looks good as-is for its purpose.\n\nWant me to help with those optional improvements or tests?\n\nYou said:\nhow about file_summarizer.py?\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\nFile Summarizer Script\n\nThis script processes chunked JSON files and extracts their content for summarization.\nIt's part of a local RAG workflow to handle large content files efficiently.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport json\nimp",
