  "content": "Skip to content\nYou said:\nI'm a beginner developer building an online market research tool with the help of free tiers of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. and having free-tier Chromebook Linux setup with limited local storage and no access to persistent LLM memory, file uploads, cloud compute, APIs, or vector DBs. The issues I currently face are as follows: 1. Context Window Management: Free tiers of ChatGPT and Claude cannot directly access your USB files. Every piece of content must be manually copied/pasted, which is impractical for large codebases. 2. Session Persistence: Free-tier models have no memory between sessions, forcing you to reestablish context repeatedly. 3. File Size Issues: 2+ million token files far exceed all free-tier context windows (typically 4K-32K tokens). 4. Manual Overhead: Managing file fragments and orchestrating the conversation flow manually would be extremely tedious and error-prone. 5. Chromebook Constraints: Linux on Chromebook has limited resources for running computationally intensive processes locally. My idea is to store large (e.g. >2M tokens) codebases, prompts, and notes on a USB drive mounted at /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/, and enable context-efficient offline review of these large files using RAG + prompt engineering strategies within the constraints of free LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude. You are an expert software developer. You critically reviewed my original idea and instead recommended a **local, file-based RAG pipeline** made up of chunking, summarization, search, and structured prompt workflows using only open-source tools. You helped create necessary folders and files in /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/.\n\nWhat you have Created for me\n\nI now have a better understanding of your local RAG pipeline system. Let me continue analyzing what you've provided.\nI can see that you've shared several core Python scripts that form the backbone of your RAG system:\n\nfile_chunker.py - Breaks down ",
