  "content": "RAG pipeline system. Let me continue analyzing what you've provided.\nI can see that you've shared several core Python scripts that form the backbone of your RAG system:\n\nfile_chunker.py - Breaks down large files into manageable chunks\nfile_summarizer.py - Creates summaries from the chunks\nmcp_helper.py - Appears to be a duplicate of file_summarizer.py (this is something we should address)\ndebug_rag_workflow.py - A diagnostic tool for the RAG workflow\nrag_assistant.py - An interactive tool for querying chunks using semantic search\nchat_exporter.py - Exports Claude chats for processing\n\nI notice that mcp_helper.py and file_summarizer.py appear to be identical. This suggests a potential issue where one might have been intended to serve a different purpose.\nLet me continue analyzing the system while I wait for any additional files you want to share. Based on what I've seen so far, I can provide some initial observations:\n\nThe system has a well-structured folder organization\nThe workflow appears to be functional but could use some refinements\nThere's some redundancy in the codebase (duplicate files)\nThe diagnostic tooling (debug_rag_workflow.py) is a nice touch\n\nNow that I've reviewed the available files, let me provide a comprehensive assessment of your local RAG pipeline and create a user guide for business users.\nAnalysis of Local RAG Pipeline\nSystem Overview\nYour system is a clever solution for working with large files through free-tier LLMs within Chromebook constraints. It breaks large files into chunks, summarizes them, and creates structured prompts that can be used with free AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude.\nKey Components\n\nFile Chunking: Breaks large files into manageable pieces\nSummarization: Creates concise summaries of each chunk\nInteractive Search: Allows semantic searching of chunks\nWorkflow Orchestration: Shell scripts that tie everything together\nChat Export: Utility to save and process AI conversations\n\nIssues to Address\n\nRedundant Files: mcp_helper.py ",
