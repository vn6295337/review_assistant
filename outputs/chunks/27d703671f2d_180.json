Check config.sh presence\nRun from the review_assistant folder:\n\nls -l \"/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/config.sh\"\nIf you get No such file or directory, it means config.sh isn't where you expect.\n\n4. How to fix\nMake sure config.sh is located in /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/\n\nIf it's somewhere else, move or copy it there, e.g.:\n\nmv /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB\\ Drive/review_assistant/scripts/config.sh /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB\\ Drive/review_assistant/\n5. Once config.sh is in the right place:\nFrom anywhere, you can do:\n\ncd \"/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/scripts\"\n./run_chat.sh \"Chat with CFO\"\n6. Alternative: Run script from the root folder\nYou can also run it from review_assistant root folder as:\n\ncd \"/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant\"\n./scripts/run_chat.sh \"Chat with CFO\"\nThis way, relative paths will resolve correctly and the script will find ../config.sh.\n\nTL;DR\nDo not run ./scripts/run_chat.sh from inside the scripts folder.\n\nRun ./run_chat.sh from inside scripts, or\n\nRun ./scripts/run_chat.sh from the root folder.\n\nMake sure config.sh is in the root folder (review_assistant/)\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you verify your folder structure or update the script to print the paths it is using, to debug further. Would you like that?\n\nYou said:\nconfig.sh is in review_assistant/scripts folder\nChatGPT said:\nGot it! Since your config.sh is inside the scripts folder, but your run_chat.sh expects it one level up (in the root review_assistant folder), that’s why you get the “not found” error.\n\nHow to fix:\nOption 1: Move config.sh to the root folder\nmv \"/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/scripts/config.sh\" \"/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/\"\nThen run from scripts folder:\n\n./run_chat.sh \"Chat with CFO\"\nThis is the easiest fix and matches how your script expects it",
