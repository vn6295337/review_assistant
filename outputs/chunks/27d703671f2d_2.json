The mcp_helper.py should be for assembling master prompts, not summarizing.\nMissing Templates: The workflow references template files that may not be present or need updating.\nPotential Dependency Issues: The system analysis report identifies missing dependencies (flask, flask_sqlalchemy, jwt, sentence_transformers, werkzeug).\nWorkflow Cleanup: The main workflow script could be simplified for better user experience.\n\nYou created the below guide.\n\n# **Local RAG Assistant User Guide**\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nThe Local RAG Assistant is a tool designed to help you work with large files and codebases using free-tier AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude. It works by breaking down large files into smaller chunks, creating summaries, and generating well-structured prompts that you can paste into AI assistants.\n\nThis guide will help you get started and make the most of this tool, even if you have limited technical knowledge.\n\n## **What is RAG?**\n\nRAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that helps AI models work with information that wouldn't fit in their context window (the amount of text they can process at once).\n\nIn simple terms:\n\n1. **Retrieval**: Finding the most relevant parts of your documents\n2. **Augmentation**: Adding this relevant information to your prompt\n3. **Generation**: Having the AI create a response based on this information\n\n## **System Requirements**\n\n- A Chromebook with Linux support\n- A USB drive with at least 1GB of free space\n- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your Chromebook's Linux environment\n- Internet connection (only for initial setup and using AI tools)\n\n## **Getting Started**\n\n### **First-Time Setup**\n\n1. **Install Dependencies** Open the Linux terminal on your Chromebook and run:\n    \n    ",
