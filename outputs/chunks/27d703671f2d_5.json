Run the debug script for diagnostics:\n    \n    \npython3 /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/debug_rag_workflow.py\n\n    \n2. Review the output to identify and resolve issues\n\n## **File Directory Structure**\n\nreview_assistant/\n├── backups/              # Backup copies of important scripts\n├── chunks/               # Raw chunks of processed files\n├── codebase/             # Your code files and chat sessions\n│   └── chat_sessions/    # Exported AI chat sessions\n├── docs/                 # Documentation files\n├── outputs/              # Generated outputs\n│   ├── chunks/           # Processed chunks\n│   ├── prompts/        ",
