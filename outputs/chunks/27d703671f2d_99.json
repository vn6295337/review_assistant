It helps catch environment issues early, which can save troubleshooting time.\n\nDo you need it?\nIf you often deploy or share this project, this script is a handy quick sanity check.\n\nIf you already have similar checks embedded in other scripts or CI/CD, it might be redundant.\n\nBut if your workflow depends on ensuring Python packages like numpy and sentence_transformers are installed and working, keep it.\n\nRefactoring Suggestions\nYour script is pretty clear and well-structured, but here are some small refactoring ideas to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency:\n\nReduce duplication: Write a helper function to check imports and print results.\n\nUse consistent package names: Your pip check uses sentence-transformers but import test uses sentence_transformers â€” keep that consistent.\n\nAdd some minor error handling: Exit with non-zero if important checks fail, useful for automation.\n\nUse functions and group related logic.\n\nRefactored version example:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# check_python_env.sh - Script to check Python environment and path settings\n\nGREEN='\\033[0;32m'\nBLUE='",
