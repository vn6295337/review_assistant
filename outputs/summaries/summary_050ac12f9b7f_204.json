However, I don\u2019t see transformers in the list yet.\n\n\u2705 Step 1: Install transformers inside your USB virtual environment\nYou can install it like this from your active review_assistant_env:\n\nsource /mnt/chromeos/removable/USB\\ Drive/linux/pip/bin/activate\npip install transformers\nThis will install it locally inside your USB-mounted Python environment.\n\n\u2705 Step 2: Confirm install\nOnce installed, run this to confirm:\n\npython3 -c \"from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('summarization'))\"\nIf it prints a summary pipeline object (or prompts to download t5-small), you\u2019re good.\n\n\u2705 Step 3: Use my updated file_summarizer.py\n\n\u2026"
