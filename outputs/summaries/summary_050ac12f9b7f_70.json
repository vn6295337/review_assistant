  "summary": "### Chunk unknown \u2014 unknown\n\ne existing code\nChatGPT said:\nPerfect \u2014 you're now set up with a cleaner, more secure, and environment-consistent test suite. \u2705\n\nIf you want to go a step further, here are a few optional enhancements you can consider later:\n\n\ud83d\udd12 Optional: Prevent accidental production secret leakage\nUse a default fallback in your auth.py:\n\nimport os\nSECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(\"SECRET_KEY\", \"fallback-dev-key\")\nThis ensures tests don\u2019t break if SECRET_KEY isn\u2019t set (but remember, in production, it must be overridden).\n\n\ud83e\uddea Optional: Add authenticate_user() tests\nThese would involve mocking the User.query method. I can show you how if you're interested \u2014 it's a good way to unit test auth without needing a real DB.\n\nWould you like that?\n\nYou said:\nHow about chat_exporter.py , do we need that?\n\n\u2026"
