  "summary": "### Chunk unknown \u2014 unknown\n\nns, so no update needed there.\n\n3. Models / Database\nNo database or ORM is involved in chat_exporter.py, so your model changes don\u2019t impact it.\n\n4. Authentication\nNo user login or token validation in chat_exporter.py. It\u2019s a local tool, so no dependency on auth changes.\n\n5. File Paths\nYou hardcoded the default output path to a USB mount:\n\ndefault='/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive/review_assistant/codebase/chat_sessions',\nIf your environment changed or you want this path configurable, maybe make this path configurable via environment variable or config file (like you did for DB URL in main.py).\n\nSummary:\nNo functional changes needed due to your recent edits.\n\nOptional small refactor: improve output path config for flexibility.\n\nOptional: move some hardcoded strings to constants for easier maintenance.\n\n\u2026"
