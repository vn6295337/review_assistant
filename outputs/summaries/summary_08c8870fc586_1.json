  "summary": "### Chunk unknown \u2014 unknown\n\nRAG pipeline system. Let me continue analyzing what you've provided.\nI can see that you've shared several core Python scripts that form the backbone of your RAG system:\n\nfile_chunker.py - Breaks down large files into manageable chunks\nfile_summarizer.py - Creates summaries from the chunks\nmcp_helper.py - Appears to be a duplicate of file_summarizer.py (this is something we should address)\ndebug_rag_workflow.py - A diagnostic tool for the RAG workflow\nrag_assistant.py - An interactive tool for querying chunks using semantic search\nchat_exporter.py - Exports Claude chats for processing\n\nI notice that mcp_helper.py and file_summarizer.py appear to be identical. This suggests a potential issue where one might have been intended to serve a different purpose.\nLet me continue analyzing the system while I wait for any additional files you want to share. Based on what I've seen so far, I can provide some initial observations:\n\nThe system has a well-structured folder organization\nThe workflow appears to be functional but could use some refinements\nThere's some redundancy in the codebase (duplicate files)\nThe diagnostic tooling (debug_rag_workflow.py) is a nice touch\n\nNow that I've reviewed the available files, let me provide a comprehensive assessment of your local RAG pipeline and create a user guide for business users.\nAnalysis of Local RAG Pipeline\n\n\u2026"
