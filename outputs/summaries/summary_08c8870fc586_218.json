  "summary": "### Chunk unknown \u2014 unknown\n\nvation\tEnhancement\nUses find -printf %T@ for newest prompt\u2014portable on GNU; not on macOS/BSD.\tIf you might share this script, add a fallback (stat -f %m) or run it through Python (import pathlib).\nClipboard option = xclip only.\tAdd wl-copy for Wayland or macOS pbcopy to be extra friendly.\n7. Error handling / exits\nBecause you already have set -e, any Python script that returns a non\u2011zero exit code will tear down the whole workflow \ud83d\udc4d. For even clearer logs:\n\ntrap 'echo -e \"${RED}\u274c Workflow aborted (${BASH_SOURCE[1]}:${LINENO})${NC}\"' ERR\n8. Non\u2011interactive + Batch\u2011friendly options\nRight now the script is fully interactive. A thin CLI wrapper makes automation easy:\n\nusage() {\n  echo \"Usage: $0 [-f FILE] [-s SIZE] [-o OVERLAP] [--no-interaction]\"\n  exit 1\n}\nThen skip the read prompts when --no-interaction is passed.\n\n9. Consistency with other helpers\nIn earlier messages we planned to rename scripts / directories (e.g. rag.sh, outputs/chunks).\nMake sure this script\u2019s paths stay in sync after you adopt those changes.\n\n\n\u2026"
