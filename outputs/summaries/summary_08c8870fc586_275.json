  "summary": "### Chunk unknown \u2014 unknown\n\n(main.py), the auth module, and the chat exporter.\n\nIt just reads chunk files from disk, searches them by keywords, highlights matches, and optionally writes JSON results.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t depend on Flask, JWT, or any config values like SECRET_KEY.\n\nNo database or model usage.\n\nShould you refactor it for your recent changes?\nNo direct changes needed due to JWT, config, or model refactors.\n\nPossible improvements / refactors (optional):\nConsistency with config:\nIf you centralize paths or settings in a config or .env, consider reading directory defaults or output paths from there instead of hardcoding.\n\nAdd a create command handler?\nYour main() references a create_command_handler() but it\u2019s not implemented in the snippet. Either implement or remove that logic for clarity.\n\nError handling:\nCould improve by adding better exception handling/logging (e.g., when loading chunks or saving results).\n\n\u2026"
