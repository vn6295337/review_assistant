Make sure those keys are consistent with how your chunk files are generated elsewhere (e.g., by your chunker or exporter).\n\nOutput format:\n\nRight now the summary is stored as JSON with keys \"source_file\" and \"summary\" containing Markdown-like text.\n\nIf you want to integrate this output with other tools, consider adding options for plain text or markdown output files.\n\nLogging vs print:\n\nFor larger workflows, switching from print() to Python's logging module will give more control over output verbosity and destination.\n\nBatch parallel processing:\n\nIf you have many chunk files, adding parallelism (e.g., with concurrent.futures) can speed up summarizing.\n\n\u2026"
