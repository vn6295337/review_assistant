  "summary": "### Chunk unknown \u2014 unknown\n\n?\nIf your workflow requires dynamically generating prompt files or documents by substituting placeholders with file contents, then yes, it\u2019s useful.\n\nThis script is essentially a lightweight template renderer that:\n\nReads a template file (e.g., Markdown with {{var_name}} placeholders)\n\nReplaces each placeholder with the contents of a specified file\n\nSaves the final output file\n\nWhen is it essential?\nIf you are using static prompt templates with placeholders that get filled by separate chunk/summary files before sending to an LLM, this script automates that step.\n\nIt complements the chunking & summarization scripts by generating the final prompt input for your LLM.\n\nWithout it, you'd have to do this substitution manually or with another tool.\n\nWhen can you skip it?\nIf you have another tool or method to do this template filling (e.g., Jinja2, manual editing, or integrated in your Python code)\n\n\u2026"
