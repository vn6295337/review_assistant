  "summary": "### Chunk unknown \u2014 unknown\n\nI interface for common maintenance tasks.\n\nQuick verification of your environment and file structure.\n\nAutomating repetitive tasks related to chunking, summarization, and cleaning.\n\nLightweight scripting support around your RAG pipeline without needing to open Python or manually run scripts.\n\nShould it be refactored?\nIt\u2019s already quite clean and modular with good use of functions, logging, and argument parsing.\n\nIf you want, here are some optional improvements, but nothing is required for it to work well:\n\nSuggested improvements (optional):\nBetter error handling for commands that may fail (e.g., rm -rf)\nYou already have some || true, which is good, but consistency on error handling could help.\n\nColor-coded output for messages and errors\nLike your check_python_env.sh, adding colors can improve readability during interactive use.\n\n\n\u2026"
