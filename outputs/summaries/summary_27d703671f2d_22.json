Directory / template bootstrap\nStrengths\nAutomatically makes missing folders & a fallback prompt template\u2014great for first\u2011run UX.\n\nTweaks\nRace condition\nIf two instances run in parallel they can both try to create the same folder or template. Harmless most of the time, but you could guard with\n\nmkdir -p \"$dir\" 2>/dev/null\nTemplate name hard\u2011wired\nExport the template path to an environment variable (DEFAULT_TEMPLATE) so other helper scripts can discover it automatically.\n\n3. Step\u202f1 \u2013 Chunk detection / creation\nIssue\tWhy it matters\tQuick fix\nchunk_count isn\u2019t recalculated after you run file_chunker.py.\tIf the user chose to create chunks, you still rely on the old zero count.\tRun chunk_count=$(find \u2026) again right after chunking.\nPath with spaces passed to Python\tYou already quote \"${PYTHON_DIR}/file_chunker.py\" and \"$source_file\", so all good here.\tNo change needed.\n4. Step\u202f2 \u2013 Summaries\nLogic gap\nYou prompt whether to regenerate summaries, but no matter what the user answers you still call file_summarizer.py over all chunks.\n\n\u2026"
